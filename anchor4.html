			<li>Although transistors were great deal of improvement over the vacuum tubes, they generated heat and damaged the sensitive areas of the computer.</li>
				<li>The Intergreated Circuit(IC) was invented in 1958 by Jack Kilby. It combined electronic components onto a small silicon disc, made from quartz.</li>
				<li>More advancement made possible the fitings of even more components on a small chip or a semi conductor.</li>
				<li>Also in third generation computers, the operating systems allowed the machines to run many different applications.</li>
				<li>These applications were monitored and coordinated by the computer's memory.</li>
